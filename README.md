## Usage

Add the Action to your [GitHub Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions#creating-a-workflow-file) like so:

```yaml
---

on: [push]

jobs:
  internal:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: test private action
    env:
      P4PORT: ssl:helixcore.example.com:1666
      P4USER: joe
    steps:
      # Checkout assets stored in GitHub
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Install p4 cli and cache it if we are running within a self hosted runner
      - name: p4 setup
        uses:
        id: setup
        with:
          setup: true
          p4_version: 21.2

      # Authenticate to Helix Core using P4PASSWD GitHub Secret
      - name: p4 login

```

### Inputs

| Name                | Description                                                  | Required | Default |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------- |
| `command`           | p4 cli command to execute                                    | yes      |         |
| `global_options`    | p4 cli arguments that are supplied on the command line before the command | no       |         |
| `arguments`         | arguments that are p4 cli command specific                   | no       |         |
| `working_directory` | directory to change into before running p4 command           | no       |         |
| `spec`              | spec content that is fed into p4 stdin to create/update resources | no       |         |
| `p4_version`        | version of p4 binary to download and cache | no       |  21.2       |
| `setup`        | used to trigger the setup routine that installs p4 | no       |  false       |



#### `command`

`command` supports all P4 [CLI commands](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/commands.html).


#### `global_options`

`global_options` supports all P4 [global options](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/global.options.html#Global_options).

Common `global_options` you may want to set would include

- `P4PORT` by including `-p ssl:helixcore.example.com:1666` in `global_options`
- `P4USER` by including `-u joe` in `global_options` 


#### `arguments`

`arguments `supports all P4 Command arguments.  To find available arguments first find the [command documentation](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/commands.html) and then look under the Options section. 


#### `working_directory`

The Action will change directory to what is provided in `working_directory`.  Note that the specified directory must exist.  


#### `spec`

If `spec` is provided the contents of `spec` will be passed to the `STDIN` of the p4 command.  In `arguments` include the option `-i` so that p4 reads from `STDIN` instead of opening your `P4EDITOR`.

#### `p4_version`

`p4_version` defines the version of the `p4` binary that will be downloaded and cached.  `p4_version` should only be specified in a `setup` GitHub Action Step. In this step the it will check if the specified version is already present, if it is not it will be loaded, cached, and added to the `$PATH`.  All subsequent steps will be able to use the `p4` found in the `$PATH`.

See our [CI workflows](https://github.com/perforce/github-actions-p4/tree/master/.github/workflows) for examples.

#### `setup`

`setup` is used to trigger the download, installation, and caching of the p4 binary.  



### Configuration

#### Environment Variables

The [P4 CLI can utilize environment variables](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/envars.html) to get configuration and the same applies to p4 in GitHub Actions.  GitHub Actions allows you to set [environment variables at multiple levels](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables):

- Workflow
- Job
- Step


```yaml
- name: p4 sync
  uses: perforce/p4-github-actions@master
  env:
  	P4CLIENT: sdp-dev-pipeline
  with:
    command: sync
    arguments: -f
```

Reference the `example.yml.disable` Workflow file in this repository for examples of setting environment variables at each level.

#### Secrets

All p4 commands will require valid authentication to your Helix Core server.  Most Workflows will start with a `p4 login` like the following:

```yaml
- name: p4 login
  uses: perforce/p4-github-actions@master
  with:
    command: login
    global_options: '-p helixcore.example.com:1666 -u andy'
    env:
    	P4PASSWD: ${{ secrets.P4PASSWD }}
```

To use the above step your Github Repository will need to have a Secret named `P4PASSWD`and the contents will need to be the Helix Core password of the user you want to authenticate as.

You can name your GitHub Repository Secret anything you would like but the Action expects you to set the environment variable `P4PASSWD` value to your secret.

### Outputs

This action creates three outputs for all p4 commands: stdout, stderr, and exit_code.

#### stdout

stderr will contain any standard output from the p4 command

#### stderr

stderr will contain any standard error output from the p4 command

#### exit_code

exit_code will be set to the exit code of the p4 command

#### Output Usage

The following is an example of how to use each of the outputs from this action:

```
- name: p4 depots
  id: depots
  uses: perforce/p4-github-actions@master
  with:
    command: depots

- name: echo outputs from previous step
  run: |
    echo "this will print the outputs from the depots command in the previous step"
    echo "${{ steps.depots.outputs.stdout }}      
    echo "${{ steps.depots.outputs.stderr }}      
    echo "${{ steps.depots.outputs.exit_code }} 
```

## What This Action Does


1) Installs the p4 CLI
2) Builds up a p4 command based on your inputs.  There are three scenarios that define how the command is built up
   1) p4 login
   2) `STDIN` required
   3) everything else

This is how the command gets built up:

```bash
COMMAND="p4 $INPUT_GLOBAL_OPTIONS $INPUT_COMMAND $INPUT_ARGUMENTS"
```


### p4 login

The `p4 login` command will read the user password from STDIN so `$P4PASSWD` gets echoed into `$COMMAND`.


```bash
echo "${P4PASSWD}" | ${COMMAND}
```

### `STDIN` required

This command format is used whenever a p4 resource must be created or updated.  The contents of your `spec` are passed to STDIN of p4 command.

```bash
echo "${INPUT_SPEC}" | ${COMMAND}
```

### Everything Else

```bash
${COMMAND}
```

## Detailed logs

To enable debug logging, create a GitHub Repository Secret named `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` with the value `true`. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging) for more information.  Run your workflow again and review the new debug logging.


## Limitations

### Network Connectivity

GitHub Hosted Actions run in Azure so the list of [Azure IPv4 addresses](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#ip-addresses) must be able to reach your Helix Core instance.  

### Available Disk Space

GitHub Hosted Actions provide ~30GB of disk space to your workflow.  Depending on your P4 Client Depot mapping you may run out of disk space.  Your options are to update your Depot mapping to reduce what data is pulled down or switching to [Self Hosted GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners). 

### p4 Binary

[GitHub Actions virtual environment](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) does not have the p4 binary and Perforce does not have an official p4 cli Docker Image.  This means the p4 binary must be downloaded at the start of each workflow execution. 


### Build Tool Availability in GitHub Actions

If I am a pipeline developer using GitHb Actions I don't have many (any?) options for getting my build tool (unreal engine, unity, etc) into GitHub Actions.  My option is to create a build server and use Self Hosted GitHub Actions.

## Contributor's Guide

Here are the steps for contributing:

1) fork the project
2) 2) clone your fork to your workstation
3) run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
4) run `npm run package` to package the action
5) create a `.actrc` and `act.secrets` file for testing locally (examples below)
6) run `act`
7) commit changes and submit PR

### act

[act](https://github.com/nektos/act) can be used to test GitHub Actions locally before having to commit any code. 

#### .actrc

The `.actrc` can be used to provide [default configuration](https://github.com/nektos/act#configuration) to `act`.  Example `.actrc` file to have `act` use the `act.secrets` file

```
--secret-file act.secrets
```


#### my.secrets

Create a `my.secrets` file (ignored via .gitignore file) that will allow the Action to authenticate to your Helix Core. 

```
P4PASSWD=""
P4PORT=""
P4USER=""
```

this is a test
